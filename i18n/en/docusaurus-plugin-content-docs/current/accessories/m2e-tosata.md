# Radxa M.2 E key to SATA Breakout Board

The M.2 E Key to SATA Breakout Board is a solution for expanding the storage capacity of embedded systems.

The M.2 E interface is commonly used for connecting storage cards, Wi-Fi modules, Bluetooth modules, etc., while the SATA interface is used for connecting hard drives, typically solid-state drives (SSDs) and mechanical hard drives. With this breakout board, users can connect SATA devices to an M.2 E interface, thereby expanding the system's storage capacity and performance.

This breakout board is very easy to use. Simply insert it directly into the M.2 E interface, connect the SATA device's SATA interface to the breakout board, and then connect the power to the designated 40-pin location.

## Feature

- Description: Converts M.2 E Key port to SATA port
- Dimensions: 22mm x 30mm x 7mm

## Installation and Use

:::tip
This tutorial uses a 2.5-inch hard drive for demonstration, which requires only 5V power. If you are using a 3.5-inch hard drive, it requires 12V power. In this case, you cannot power it from the 40-pin connector and will need to connect an additional 12V power supply.

### Preparations Before Use

- ROCK 5A
- M.2 E Key to SATA Breakout Board
- 15-Pin SATA Power to 4-Pin Dupont Cable

:::tip
Connect the black wire to GND, the red wire to the 5V connector, and the yellow wire to the 12V connector (not needed for 2.5-inch SATA hard drives).

### Installation Process

- Connect one end of the SATA data cable to the SATA hard drive and the other end to the M.2 E Key to SATA breakout board. Then, insert the breakout board into the M.2 E Key slot on the ROCK 5A and secure it with screws.
