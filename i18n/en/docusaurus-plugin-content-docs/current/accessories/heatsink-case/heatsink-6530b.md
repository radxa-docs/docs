## Installation Guide

This guide uses Radxa Cubie A7Z as an example for installing the 6530B heatsink.

### Notes

- Power off the device before installation, and avoid plugging/unplugging the fan connector while the board is powered.
- Tighten the screws gradually in a diagonal pattern to avoid uneven pressure that can cause poor contact with the SoC.
- If the thermal pad has protective films, remove the films on both sides before applying the pad.
- Tighten the screws until they are secure. Avoid overtightening to prevent stripped threads or board damage.

### Package Contents

- 1× Heatsink
- 2× Thermal pads
- 4× Screws (CM2 × 4 × 4 mm)

Note: One of the thermal pads is a spare and can be used as needed.

### Place the Thermal Pad

Align the thermal pad to the SoC coverage area and apply it flat onto the SoC.
