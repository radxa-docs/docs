### Power supply

The ROCK 5 ITX is powered by a 12V power supply, and it is recommended to use a minimum 12V/3A power adapter.

::: warning

- The system only supports 12V input
- DC input/POE input/ATX PWR input to the motherboard are all 12V, and the three power supplies are connected in parallel, which does not support multiple power supplies being inserted simultaneously
- The 12V power supply directly supplies SATA PWR and EDP. If a higher power supply is mistakenly inserted, it will damage the corresponding components and circuits
