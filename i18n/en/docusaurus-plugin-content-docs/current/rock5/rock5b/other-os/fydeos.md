# Open FydeOS

**FydeOS** is an operating system based on the open source project [Chromium OS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChromiumOS), which uses the Linux kernel and includes both a browser platform and container technology. A platform with FydeOS installed supports the latest web application standards, is compatible with Android apps and the Linux environment, and provides a user experience similar to that of a Chromebook. [Above from [Draft: FydeOS-Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft:FydeOS)].

## FydeOS on ROCK 5
