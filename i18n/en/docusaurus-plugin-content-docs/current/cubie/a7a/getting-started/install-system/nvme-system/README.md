# Installing System to NVMe SSD

M.2 NVMe SSDs are high-speed, high-capacity, and cost-effective storage devices that offer faster read/write speeds compared to MicroSD cards, eMMC modules, and UFS modules. They are an excellent choice for users looking to further enhance their system's performance and boot times.

We provide two methods to install the system to an M.2 NVMe SSD:

- **With an M.2 NVMe SSD Enclosure**: The installation process is similar to that of a MicroSD card and relatively straightforward.

- **Without an M.2 NVMe SSD Enclosure**: Use the `dd` command to install the system image to the M.2 NVMe SSD.

The Radxa Cubie A7A features a PCIe 3.0 FPC interface that supports PCIe Gen3.0 ×1 lane expansion capability.

To use the PCIe 3.0 FPC interface, you'll need to purchase a PCIe to M.2 M Key HAT and install it according to the accessory instructions.
