# Installing System to NVMe SSD

M.2 NVMe SSDs are high-speed, high-capacity, and cost-effective storage devices that offer faster read/write speeds compared to MicroSD cards and UFS modules. They are an excellent choice for users looking to significantly improve their system's read/write and boot performance.

We provide two methods to install the system on an M.2 NVMe SSD:

- For users with an M.2 NVMe SSD enclosure, the installation process is similar to installing the system on a MicroSD card and is relatively straightforward.

- For users without an M.2 NVMe SSD enclosure, you can use the `dd` command to install the system image to the M.2 NVMe SSD.

The Radxa ROCK 4D features an FPC interface that provides PCIe Gen2 ×1 lane expansion capability.

To use the FPC interface, you'll need to purchase a PCIe to M.2 M Key HAT and install it according to the accessory instructions.
