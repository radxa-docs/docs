# Installing the System

Radxa ROCK 4D supports three methods for system installation: MicroSD card, UFS module, and M.2 NVMe SSD. Users can choose the appropriate boot medium based on their needs.

- **Install using MicroSD card** - Simple operation, only requires a card reader to complete the system installation; however, read/write speeds are slower compared to UFS module and M.2 NVMe SSD.

- **Install using UFS module** - Faster read/write speeds compared to MicroSD cards. The ROCK 4D supports hot-swappable UFS modules. For more information about UFS modules, please refer to the [Radxa UFS Module Page](https://radxa.com/products/accessories/ufs-module).

- **Install using M.2 NVMe SSD** - Even faster read/write speeds than UFS modules, but requires a dedicated adapter board for use.

In summary, if you don't have high requirements for read/write performance, you can use a MicroSD card as the boot medium. If you need faster read/write speeds and don't want to use an additional adapter board with your ROCK 4D, you can install the system using a UFS module. For even higher performance requirements, you can install the system using an M.2 NVMe SSD.
