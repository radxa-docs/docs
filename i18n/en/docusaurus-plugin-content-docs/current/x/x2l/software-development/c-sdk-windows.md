# Control RP2040 on Windows

## Introducts relationship between Intel N100,RP2040 and 40-PIN GPIO

<RELATION />

## 40 PIN Usage

In order to operate the IO resources on RP2040, we need a complete software environment, such as MicroPython or C/C++ SDK, here we mainly introduce a set of C/C++ SDKs, namely pico-sdk and pico-examples. pico-sdk mainly provides some APIs to operate the RP2040, while pico-examples provides a compilation framework for us to add our own programs according to the compilation framework provided by pico-examples. pico-sdk provides some APIs to operate the RP2040, while pico-examples provides a compilation framework for us to add our own programs according to the compilation framework provided by pico-examples.

### Flash

Press the BOOTSEL key and a USB device will pop up. Copy the compiled .uf2 file to the USB device of RP2040 and wait until the USB device disappears, then the programme will start to execute.
