The Radxa X2L integrates an Intel J4125 CPU and a [RP2040](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RP2040) MCU, which communicate with each other via USB and UART.
The RP2040 exists as a USB memory device in the system, and the program can be burned by dragging and dropping the files to the USB device.
In addition, they share the same UART communication interface, which enables Intel J4125 to control the RP2040 through UART, for example, to realize the control of RP2040 GPIO through the UART interface.
The relationship between the two is shown in the following figure:
