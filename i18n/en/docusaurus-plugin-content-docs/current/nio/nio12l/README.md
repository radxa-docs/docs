# NIO 12L

The Renesas NIO 12L is a compact, low-power and high-performance single board computer the size of a cell phone. It is developed on a MediaTek MT8395 (codenamed Genio 1200) octa-core processor with an integrated Mali-G57 MC5 GPU and a standalone AI processing module. This single-board computer provides users with a smooth desktop experience and superior AI computing capabilities. Its rich peripheral interfaces support a wide range of complex application scenarios, thus expanding its application possibilities.

The NIO 12L is designed to combine high-performance processing power with low power consumption, making it ideal for a wide range of advanced applications including, but not limited to, advanced multimedia processing, complex AI and Internet of Things (IoT) solutions.
