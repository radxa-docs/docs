# Using the System

This guide explains how to use the system, including system startup, system information, and recommendations for using Dragon Q6A with or without a display.

## Starting the System

Ensure that the system is properly installed on the boot media, then power on the Dragon Q6A using the power adapter. When the system boots up normally, the power indicator will light up green, and the status LED will blink blue.

:::tip Recommendation

For first-time users of Dragon Q6A, we recommend following the [Quick Start](./quickly_start.md) guide for a detailed and complete setup process.

## System Information

When you first start the system, you'll need to log in using the default username and password.

The default credentials for Radxa OS are as follows:

| Item     | Value   |
| :------- | :------ |
| Username | `radxa` |
| Password | `radxa` |

## Using the System

This section provides usage recommendations, particularly for users without a display, to help you get started with your Dragon Q6A more easily.

### With a Display

Connect the board to a display using an HDMI cable. If the system boots up normally, the display will show the system interface. You can then operate the Ubuntu system using the display, keyboard, and mouse. The process is straightforward.

### Without a Display

For users without a display, you can operate the system via [UART Login](../system-use/uart_debug.md) or [SSH Login](../system-use/ssh.md).

These methods use command-line interaction and are suitable for users with some development experience.
