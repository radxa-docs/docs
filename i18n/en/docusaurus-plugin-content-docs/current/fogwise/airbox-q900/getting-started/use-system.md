# Using the System

This guide provides instructions on how to use the system, including system startup, user information, and recommendations for both display and headless modes.

## Starting the System

Power on the Fogwise® AIRbox Q900 using the 12V DC power adapter. If the system boot medium contains a valid operating system, it will start automatically.

## System Information

On first boot, you'll need to log in using the default credentials:

| Username | Password |
| :------: | :------: |
|  radxa   |  radxa   |

## System Usage

This section provides recommendations for using the board in both display and headless modes to help you get started more easily.

### Display Mode

Display mode involves connecting the board to a monitor using an HDMI cable, allowing you to interact with the system through a graphical user interface using a mouse and keyboard.

This method is straightforward for system operation, as you can configure settings through the system options.

### Headless Mode

Headless mode means using the board without a display. You can access the system via [UART login](../system-use/uart-login.md) or [SSH login](../system-use/ssh-login.md).

This method relies on command-line interaction, with more emphasis on using command-line operations to control the system.
