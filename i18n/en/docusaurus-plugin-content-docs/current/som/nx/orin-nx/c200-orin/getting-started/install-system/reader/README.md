# Installing System Using Balena Etcher

The Radxa C200 Orin Development Kit uses the system images provided by Radxa. You need to flash the BIOS firmware before you can boot the system from a USB drive or NVMe SSD.

For BIOS firmware flashing, please refer to one of the following tutorials:

- [Use Radxa Prebuilt BIOS Firmware](../../../low-level-dev/prebuild-image.md): Use the prebuilt BIOS firmware provided by Radxa, suitable for beginner users
- [Compile / Flash Radxa BIOS Firmware](../../../low-level-dev/build-image.md): Compile and flash the BIOS firmware yourself, suitable for experienced users

We can then use the Balena Etcher tool to flash the system image to a USB drive or NVMe SSD.
