# Install System

The Android system installation steps are similar to the Linux system. You can refer to the [Install System](../../getting-started/install-system/) tutorial for operation.

Notes:

- MNVMe SSD cannot boot Android system
- MicroSD card and eMMC boot use the same Android system image
- UFS module uses a dedicated Android system image
