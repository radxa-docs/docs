# Yocto Build

The Yocto Project (YP) is an open-source collaborative project that helps developers create custom Linux-based systems.

The main versions of the Yocto Project for Radxa series boards based on Rockchip SoC design are:

- [Community Version](https://github.com/radxa/meta-rockchip/tree/scarthgap)
- [Vendor Version](https://github.com/radxa/yocto-manifests/tree/scarthgap)

## Community Version

The community version of meta-rockchip provides OpenEmbedded BSP support for devices based on Rockchip SoCs and uses upstream sources as much as possible.

## Vendor Version

We have added support for some Radxa devices based on Rockchip's vendor version to provide a better Yocto Project build experience.
