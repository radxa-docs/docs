# Product Introduction

## Key Features

The Radxa ROCK 3B is a single board computer (SBC) based on the Pico-ITX form factor (100 mm x 75 mm), which not only outperforms its competitors, but is also widely acclaimed for its excellent mechanical compatibility.The ROCK 3B series consists not only of the Community Edition, but also the Industrial Edition, which is customised specifically for industrial applications. With a wide range of interface options and specialised support for wide temperature ranges, the industrial version of the ROCK 3B provides a reliable and powerful platform for manufacturers and customers in the industrial sector. Here, creative sparks can be ignited, concepts can be transformed into innovations, and numerous ideas can be realised, offering exciting possibilities.

### Interfaces galore

The ROCK 3B offers a wealth of interfaces, including multiple USB, HDMI and other ports, making it easy to connect external devices and expand functionality. See [Parameter Configuration](#Parameter-Configuration) for details.

### Accessory Eco-Rich

ROCK 3B supports a variety of cameras and displays.

### Powerful multimedia processing

The CPU is a quad-core A55 (ARM v8) with a 2 GHz clock frequency, providing powerful computing and multi-tasking capabilities, while the GPU integrates Mali G52 and supports OpenGL ES 1.1/2.0/3.2, OpenCL 2.0, and Vulkan 1.1 graphics interfaces, providing a highly efficient and smooth graphic processing experience.

### Rich Operating System Support

We support a variety of operating systems, including Radxa's official Debian system and Android system, as well as some third-party operating systems, which are suitable for various application scenarios.

### Development Potential

As a powerful development platform, ROCK 3B has great potential for AI, edge computing, embedded systems and other fields.

### Open source support

ROCK 3B provides complete hardware design schematics and software source code, a feature that allows most DIY design enthusiasts and developers to make personalised modifications and functional extensions, and attracts a large number of open source enthusiasts to be active in the community, which is conducive to the promotion of knowledge-sharing and technological innovation.
