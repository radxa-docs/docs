## Acrylic Case Disassembly

:::tip
This section is for users who have purchased the acrylic case. If you don't have an acrylic case, you can skip this step!
:::

Use a screwdriver to remove the screws securing the top and bottom acrylic panels, then remove the brass standoffs and acrylic panels.

## Heatsink (8420B) Removal

Before assembling the AI PC case kit, you need to remove the Radxa 8420B heatsink from the O6 motherboard.

### Step 1: Disconnect Heatsink Cable

Disconnect the heatsink cable from the O6 motherboard.

</div>

### Step 2: Remove Heatsink

Use a screwdriver to loosen the four heatsink mounting screws in a cross pattern to ensure even pressure distribution.

</div>

## AI PC Case Assembly

### Step 1: Apply Thermal Paste

Apply an appropriate amount of thermal paste onto the motherboard's SOC chip.

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>

</div>

### Step 2: Install Heatsink Assembly

Align the heatsink's mounting posts with the motherboard's heatsink mounting holes. Tighten the four spring screws in a cross pattern to avoid damaging the chip.

After securing the heatsink, connect the fan cable to the corresponding port on the motherboard.

</div>

### Step 3: Install Power Button

Insert the power button into the corresponding hole on the case.

</div>

### Step 4: Install LED Board

:::danger
Confirm the installation direction of the LED board according to the onboard LED position.
:::

Install the LED board to the corresponding interface on the motherboard assembly.

</div>

### Step 5: Secure Motherboard

Insert the motherboard into the case at an angle, ensuring the motherboard's mounting holes align with the case's mounting holes. Secure the motherboard with four CM2.5\*5mm screws.

</div>

### Step 6 (Optional): Install PCIe to OCuLink Adapter

This is mainly used for external GPU expansion. Install according to your needs.

**Installation Instructions**:

1. Remove the protective tape from the gold fingers (contact area between the adapter and slot).
2. Align the external interface side of the adapter with the case's hole (Figure ①).
3. Align the adapter's slot with the motherboard's slot (Figure ②), then press down firmly (Figure ③). The slot's latch will automatically engage when properly installed.

### Step 7 (Optional): Install PCIe to M.2 Adapter

This is mainly used for expanding M.2 SSD storage. Install according to your needs.

:::tip
The SSD in the diagram needs to be purchased separately. Use CM2\*4mm screws to secure the SSD.
:::

**Installation Instructions**:

1. Remove the protective tape from the gold fingers (contact area between the adapter and slot).
2. Align the adapter's slot with the motherboard's slot, then press down firmly. The slot's latch will automatically engage when properly installed. (Refer to the PCIe to OCuLink adapter installation diagram. Note that the PCIe to M.2 adapter doesn't need to align with the case's holes.)

</div>

### Step 8: Install Case Bracket

Orient the bracket with the notch facing the case's interface direction. After aligning the bracket's screw holes with the case's mounting holes, secure it with seven KM2\*6mm screws.

</div>

### Step 9: Install Silicone Plug

For users who are not installing a PCIe adapter or are installing a PCIe to M.2 adapter, you can use the silicone plug to cover the unused interface holes to prevent dust entry.

### Step 10: Install Vent Covers

:::tip
First-batch users will receive two vent covers, with one as a spare. In the future, vent covers will be pre-installed, making this step unnecessary!
:::

Attach the vent covers to the exhaust vents on the base to ensure proper airflow from the heatsink exits through the bottom cover.

</div>

### Step 11: Install Bottom Cover

Align the ventilation holes on the bottom cover with the case's interface direction, then secure it with CM3\*8mm screws.

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>

</div>

### Step 12: Install Rubber Feet

Attach the four rubber feet to their corresponding positions on the bottom cover.
