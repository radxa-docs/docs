## 2. Removing the Acrylic Enclosure

:::tip
This step applies only to users who purchased the acrylic enclosure. If not purchased, skip this step!
:::

Use a screwdriver to remove the screws securing the acrylic panels, then remove the mounting pillars and acrylic panels.

## 3. Removing the Heatsink (8420B)

Before assembling the AI PC Developer Kit, the Radxa 8420B heatsink must be removed

### Step 1: Disconnect the Heatsink Cable

Disconnect the heatsink cable from the Orion O6 motherboard.

## 4. Assembling the AI PC Developer Kit

### Step 1: Apply Thermal Paste

Apply an appropriate amount of thermal paste onto the motherboard's SOC chip.

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>

</div>

### Step 2: Secure the Heatsink

Align the heatsink's mounting pillars with the motherboard's mounting holes. Tighten the four spring screws in a cross pattern to avoid damaging the chip. After securing the heatsink, connect the fan cable to the corresponding motherboard header.

### Step 6 (optional): Install PCIe to OCuLink adapter board

Primarily used for external GPU expansion. Install as needed.

Installation Instructions:

1.Remove the protective tape from the adapter's gold fingers (contact area between adapter and slot).

2.Align the adapter's external interface side with the enclosure's cutout (Diagram ①).

3.Align the adapter's slot with the motherboard's slot (Diagram ②), then gently press down (Diagram ③). The slot latch will automatically engage when properly installed.

### Step 6 (Optional): Install PCIe to M.2 Adapter Board

Primarily used for expanding M.2 SSD storage. Install as needed.

:::tip
The SSD shown in the diagram must be purchased separately. Use a CM2\*4mm screw to secure the SSD
:::

Installation Instructions:

1.Remove the protective tape from the adapter's gold fingers.

2.Align the adapter's slot with the motherboard's slot and gently press down (refer to PCIe to OCuLink adapter installation diagram). Note: The PCIe to M.2 adapter doesn't require alignment with enclosure cutouts.

### Step 7: Install the Enclosure Bracket

Orient the bracket with its notch facing the enclosure's ports. Align the bracket's screw holes with the enclosure's mounting points, then secure with seven KM2\*6mm screws.

### Step 8: Install the Silicone Plug

For users not installing PCIe adapters or only installing the PCIe to M.2 adapter, use the silicone plug to cover unused ports and prevent dust ingress.

### Step 9: Install Ventilation Baffles

:::tip
Early adopters will receive two ventilation baffles (one spare). Later versions will come with pre-installed baffles, making this step unnecessary
:::

Attach the ventilation baffle to the base's exhaust vents to direct all airflow through the bottom cover.
