Radxa OS enables a swap **partition** by default, with a size of about **half of the physical memory**, which is usually enough for most daily use cases.

When the device has relatively small RAM and you occasionally run heavy workloads, you can **add an extra swap file** on top of the default swap partition as a temporary extension and safety buffer.

The following describes how to add a simple swap file on a Radxa device.

:::caution Note
Swap is only a **fallback** mechanism. It will slow down the system and increase write wear on eMMC/SD/SSD. Do not rely on it as a long‑term replacement for physical memory.
:::

## 1. When do you need an extra swap file?

- RAM is small, and you occasionally compile large projects or run memory‑hungry programs
- You want to reduce the chance of the system going OOM and crashing when memory usage spikes

If you care about extreme performance or flash lifetime, you can also choose not to enable any additional swap.

## 2. Check current memory and swap

```bash
free -h
sudo swapon --show
```

If `swapon --show` prints nothing, it means no swap is currently enabled (or only a swap partition that is not active).

## 3. Create and enable a swap file (2G example)

```bash
sudo fallocate -l 2G /swapfile    # create file
sudo chmod 600 /swapfile          # only root can access
sudo mkswap /swapfile             # format as swap
sudo swapon /swapfile             # enable immediately
```

Verify:

```bash
sudo swapon --show
free -h
```

You should see an extra swap entry, and the `Swap` line in `free -h` will increase accordingly.

## 4. Enable the swap file at boot

First, back up `fstab` (recommended):

```bash
sudo cp /etc/fstab /etc/fstab.bak
```

Edit `fstab`:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/fstab
```

Add the following line at the end of the file:

```bash
/swapfile none swap sw 0 0
```

Save and exit, then test whether the configuration works:

```bash
sudo swapoff /swapfile
sudo swapon -a
sudo swapon --show
```

If `/swapfile` appears in the output, the `fstab` configuration is valid.

:::tip
`swapon -a` re‑enables all swap devices according to `/etc/fstab`. It is a safe way to verify that your configuration is correct.
:::

## 5. Disable and remove the swap file

If you no longer need the swap file, follow these steps to disable and remove it:

1. Turn off swap:

   ```bash
   sudo swapoff /swapfile
   ```

2. Edit `/etc/fstab` and remove or comment out the line:

   ```bash
   /swapfile none swap sw 0 0
   ```

3. Delete the file:

   ```bash
   sudo rm /swapfile
   ```

After these steps, the system will go back to running without this swap file.
