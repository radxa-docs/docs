- Dragon Player is the default media player included in the Debian system. If Dragon Player is not installed in the system, you can execute the following command to install it.

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install dragonplayer
```

- Enter your password if prompted, and then wait for the installation to complete.
  Once Dragon Player is installed, you can use the following command to open a video:

```bash
dragon /path/to/video/file
```

- Replace "/path/to/video/file" with the actual path and filename of the video you want to play. For example, if your video is located in the `Videos` folder in your home directory and is called "myvideo.mp4", the command would look like this:

```bash
dragon ~/Videos/myvideo.mp4
```

- Of course, you can also directly double-click the video file icon to play it.

As for the video formats supported by Dragon Player, it can decode any format that is supported by the FFmpeg library. This includes popular video formats such as MP4, AVI, MKV, WMV, FLV, MOV, and more.
