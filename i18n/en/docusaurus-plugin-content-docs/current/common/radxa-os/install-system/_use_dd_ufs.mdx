This guide explains how to install the system to UFS using the `dd` command when the system can boot normally from a {props?.boot_device ?? 'MicroSD card'} .

:::warning
Installing the system will format the UFS module or onboard UFS. Please back up any important data in advance!
:::

## Prerequisites

To use the `dd` command to install the system to UFS, you need to meet the following conditions:

- The system can boot normally from a {props?.boot_device ?? 'MicroSD card'}
- UFS is installed on the board or the board has onboard UFS

## Hardware Connection

<Tabs queryString="system boot">
<TabItem value="UFS Module" default={props.tag === "ufs_module"} attributes={{className: props.tag === "ufs_board" && "tab_none"}} >

UFS Module Installation Steps:

1. Observe the notch direction on the UFS module and the notch marking on the board's UFS module interface to determine the correct installation orientation.
2. Place the UFS module above the board's UFS module interface, ensuring the UFS module interface is properly aligned with the board's UFS module interface.
3. Gently press one end of the UFS module until you hear a "click" sound, indicating successful installation. Then press the other end in the same way to ensure the UFS module is properly installed.

</div>

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="Onboard UFS" default={props.tag === "ufs_board"} attributes={{className: props.tag === "ufs_module" && "tab_none"}} >

If your board has onboard UFS, no installation is required.

## System Installation

### Download System Image

Access the <a href={props?.download_page ?? '../../../../download'}>Resource Download</a> page from your device and download the **latest system image** to the device.

:::tip Image Note
The downloaded system image is a compressed file and needs to be extracted before use!
:::

You can use the `wget` command to download the system image file to your device.

<NewCodeBlock tip={`radxa@${props?.board ?? 'device'}$`} type="device">

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install wget -y
wget <download_url>
```

</NewCodeBlock>

Where `<download_url>` is the download URL of the system image file. You can copy the image download URL from the <a href={props?.download_page ?? '../../../../download'}>Resource Download</a> page to replace it.

Download example: <code>{`wget ${props?.download_url ?? '<download_url>'}`}</code>

#### Extract System Image

Our system images are generally in `*.img.xz` format and need to be extracted before use.

<NewCodeBlock tip={`radxa@${props?.board ?? 'device'}$`} type="device">

```
sudo apt install xz-utils -y
unxz <path_to_image_unxz>
```

</NewCodeBlock>

Where `<path_to_image_unxz>` is the path to the system image file, which needs to be replaced with the actual system image file path.

Extraction example:

<code>{`unxz ${props?.path_to_image_unxz ?? "<path_to_image_unxz>"}`}</code>

### Determine Device Path

You can use the `lsblk` command to check the device path and determine it based on the disk capacity.

Note: If the disk capacities are similar, you can safely remove and reinsert the UFS module to observe which device path appears and disappears, thus determining the correct device path.

<NewCodeBlock tip={`radxa@${props?.board ?? 'device'}$`} type="device">

```
lsblk
```

</NewCodeBlock>

If the system recognizes the UFS device, it will typically be identified as a `/dev/sd*` device.

Terminal output example:

```
NAME        MAJ:MIN RM   SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINTS
···
sda           8:0    0 119.2G  0 disk
└─sda1        8:1    0 119.2G  0 part
···
```

### Install System Image

Use the `dd` command to install the system image to the UFS.

<NewCodeBlock tip={`radxa@${props?.board ?? 'device'}$`} type="device">

```
sudo dd if=<path_to_image> of=<device_target> bs=4M status=progress
```

</NewCodeBlock>

Write example:

<code>{`sudo dd if=${
  props?.path_to_image ?? "<path_to_image>"
} of=/dev/sda bs=4M status=progress`}</code>

Parameter description:

- `<path_to_image>`: The path to the system image file, which needs to be replaced with the actual system image file path.

- `<device_target>`: The device path of the UFS module, which needs to be replaced with the actual UFS module's device path.

- `bs=4M`: Block size for writing.

- `status=progress`: Display write progress.

### Verify Write Result

After the system installation is complete, you can use the `lsblk` command to check if the UFS partition table has been created correctly.

<NewCodeBlock tip={`radxa@${props?.board ?? 'device'}$`} type="device">

```
lsblk
```

</NewCodeBlock>

Terminal output example:

```
NAME        MAJ:MIN RM   SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINTS
···
sda           8:0    0 119.2G  0 disk
├─sda1        8:1    0   128M  0 part
├─sda2        8:2    0   2.3G  0 part
└─sda3        8:3    0   6.4G  0 part
···
```
