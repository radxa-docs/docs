### Static IP Configuration

Networks typically use dynamic IP addresses to better manage IP address allocation. Dynamic IP addresses are automatically assigned through DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol), which means each device is given a unique IP address when it connects to the network. This method makes network management easier and avoids the possibility of IP address conflicts between devices.

If you need to set a static IP address, you will need to manually assign a fixed IP address to the device.

As shown in the following steps:

    Applications >> Settings >> Advanced Network Configuration >> IPv4 Settings >> select Manual >> Add >> enter address, netmask, gatewat >> Save
