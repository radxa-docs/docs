The system default sound output priority is: Bluetooth Audio > Headphones > HDMI Audio. After manual selection of audio output, The selection will be raised to the highest priority.

It means that connecting other audio devices does not switch the audio output when the device is playing at the highest priority device.

## Audio Settings

### Desktop Settings

Left-clicking the volume icon on the desktop taskbar brings up the audio output selector; this allows you to select between the internal audio outputs.
It also allows you to select any external audio devices, such as USB sound cards and Bluetooth audio devices.
A blue tick is shown against the currently selected audio output device — simply left-click the desired output to change this.
The volume control and mute operate on the currently selected device.

### Command Line Config

In addition to the graphical interface, we can also set up the audio from the terminal. We provide `alsamixer` for volume management, entering the setting ui by this command:

```bash
alsamixer
```

Use the `up` and `down` arrow keys to adjust the volume.

```bash

```

For changing to other audio output devices, you should get which devices are connected at first, a search is provided below:

```bash
pacmd list-sinks | grep -e 'index:' -e 'name:'
```

You will see the index and name of the connected audio devices like this:

```bash
    index: 0
        name: <alsa_output.platform-dp0-sound.HDMI__hw_rockchiphdmi1__sink>
    index: 1
        name: <alsa_output.platform-es8316-sound.HiFi__hw_rockchipes8316__sink>
  * index: 7
        name: <bluez_sink.C0_09_0B_48_26_53.a2dp_sink>
```

The index with `*` indicates that it's the highest priority device.
The following command would help you to change default output device:

```bash
pacmd set-default-sink alsa_output.platform-es8316-sound.HiFi__hw_rockchipes8316__sink  # 'alsa_output.platform-es8316-sound.HiFi__hw_rockchipes8316__sink' is the name of the device you want to set.
```
