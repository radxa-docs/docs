We recommend using the open-source image flashing tool Etcher, developed by our partner Balena. Etcher has a user-friendly interface and powerful features, with support for Windows, Linux, and macOS systems. Next, we'll show you how to use Etcher to write an image to an SD card.

1. Download Etcher and install it.

2. Open Etcher

   <Image

     model={props.model}
     fallback="rock5a"
   />

3. Open Etcher and click `Flash from file` to select the image to write to.

4. Click `Select target` to select the device, please select carefully.

   <Image
     src="/img/common/etcher/#model#-step3.webp"
     model={props.model}
     fallback="rock5a"
   />

5. Click `Flash!` Start writing and wait for the write progress bar to complete.

   <Image
     src="/img/common/etcher/#model#-step4.webp"
     model={props.model}

   />

6. When writing the image successfully, Etcher will display `Flash Complete!`.
   <Image
     src="/img/common/etcher/#model#-step5.webp"
