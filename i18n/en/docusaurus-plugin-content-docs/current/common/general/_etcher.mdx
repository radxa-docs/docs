Balena Etcher is a cross-platform and user friendly image file burning tool that we recommend you use.

1. Download [Etcher](https://etcher.balena.io/#download-etcher/) and install it.

   <Image
     src="/img/common/etcher/#model#-step1.webp"
     model={props.model}
     fallback="rock5a"
   />

2. Open Etcher and click `Flash from file` to select the image to write to.

   <Image
     src="/img/common/etcher/#model#-step2.webp"
     model={props.model}
     fallback="rock5a"
   />

3. Click `Select target` to select the device, please select carefully.

   <Image
     src="/img/common/etcher/#model#-step3.webp"
     model={props.model}
     fallback="rock5a"
   />

4. Click `Flash!` Start writing and wait for the write progress bar to complete.

   <Image
     src="/img/common/etcher/#model#-step4.webp"
     model={props.model}
     fallback="rock5a"
   />

5. When writing the image successfully, Etcher will display `Flash Complete!`.
   <Image
     src="/img/common/etcher/#model#-step5.webp"
     model={props.model}
     fallback="rock5a"
   />

**If there is an error in flashing, please try again. **
