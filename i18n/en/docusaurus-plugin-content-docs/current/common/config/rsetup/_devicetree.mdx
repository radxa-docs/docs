### Device tree settings

Device Tree Overlays make it possible to support multiple hardware configurations with a single kernel, without explicitly loading or masking kernel modules.

You can use `rsetup` to manage overlays.

#### How to Enable an Overlay

In the screen of `rsetup`, use the arrow keys to move up, down, left, right, and select.

Select the third item `Overlays`:

<img src="/img/common/rsetup/overlays.webp" width="700" />

Select `Yes`.

<img src="/img/common/rsetup/warning.webp" width="700" />

Select `Manage overlays`,

<img src="/img/common/rsetup/mannage_overlays.webp" width="700" />

Press the spacebar to select the Overlay you want, a `*` mark when selected means it is enabled.
