  2. When the system recognises the Penta SATA HAT, you can see the SATA devices (sda/sdb/sdc/sdd).

- Software Support

To make the OLED display and fan on the top panel work properly, we provide the rockpi-penta software package, which can be installed with the following commands.

wget https://github.com/radxa/rockpi-penta/releases/download/v0.2.2/rockpi-penta-0.2.2.deb

```

2. Software Configuration

Edit /etc/rockpi-penta.conf, and use the following command to make it effective.

```
sudo systemctl restart rockpi-penta.service
```

# and lv1 at 50% power, lv2 at 75% power, and lv3 at 100% power.
# When the temperature is below lv0, the fan is turned off.
# You can change these values if necessary.
lv0 = 35
lv1 = 40
lv2 = 45
lv3 = 50

[key]
