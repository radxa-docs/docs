- Viewing Mounts

  1. You can check if the SSD card is recognised by `lsblk`.

  <pre>
    radxa@{props.model}:~$ lsblk NAME MAJ:MIN RM SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT mmcblk0
    179:0 0 14.5G 0 disk ├─mmcblk0p1 179:1 0 16M 0 part /config └─mmcblk0p2
    179:2 0 14.4G 0 part / mmcblk0boot0 179:32 0 4M 1 disk mmcblk0boot1 179:64 0
    4M 1 disk zram0 254:0 0 3.8G 0 disk [SWAP] nvme0n1 259:0 0 238.5G 0 disk
  </pre>

  2. At this point you can see that the system has recognised the SSD (**nvme0n1**).
