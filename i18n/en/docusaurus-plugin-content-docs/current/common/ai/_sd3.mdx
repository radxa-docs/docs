Stable Diffusion 3 Medium is a Multimodal Diffusion Transformer (MMDiT) text-to-image model that features greatly improved performance in image quality, typography, complex prompt understanding, and resource-efficiency. The current usage involves porting the open-source model [Stable Diffusion 3 Medium](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-diffusion-3-medium) to the SG2300X chip series products via the Sophon SDK for local TPU hardware-accelerated inference, enabling fast inference to generate stylized images with text, and using Gradio for user interaction.

For more technical details on Stable Diffusion 3 Medium, please refer to the [official website](https://stability.ai/news/stable-diffusion-3) and the [research paper](https://stability.ai/news/stable-diffusion-3-research-paper).

### Application Deployment

**Recommend TPU Memory Setting: NPU->7615MB, VPU->2360MB, VPP->2360MB**

- Clone the repository

  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/zifeng-radxa/SD3-Medium-TPU.git
  ```

- Download the Stable Diffusion 3 Medium models package provided by radxa

  Users can also compile the Stable Diffusion 3 Medium model by referring to [Model Conversion](#model-conversion)

  ```bash
  cd SD3-Medium-TPU/python_demo/
  bash tar_downloader.sh
  ```

- Extract the model in the current directory

  ```bash
  tar -xvf models.tar.gz
  ```

- Configure the environment

  **It's necessary to create a virtual environment to avoid potential interference with other applications**, for instructions on using virtual environments, please refer [here](../ai-tools/virtualenv_usage)

  ```bash
  cd SD3-Medium-TPU/python_demo/
  python3 -m virtualenv .venv
  source .venv/bin/activate
  ```

- Install dependencies

  ```bash
  pip3 install --upgrade pip
  pip3 install -r requirements.txt
  ```

- Start the Web service

  ```bash
  python3 gr.py
  ```

- Access the Airbox IP address on port 8999 via a browser
