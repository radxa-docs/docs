## System Image

You need to prepare in advance the image file built by the Yocto project: <code>{`core-image-minimal-rockchip-${props?.soc ?? "<soc>"}-${props?.board_name ?? "<board_name>"}.rootfs.wic`}</code>.

For the Yocto project build steps, refer to the [Build System](../build-system) document.

## Install System to Onboard eMMC

This section describes how to use the [RKDevTool](https://dl.radxa.com/tools/windows/windows_RKDevTool_Release_v3.32.zip) tool to flash the system image to the onboard eMMC.

Note: Make sure the board has entered Maskrom mode and is correctly recognized by the system.

:::tip

To use the RKDevTool tool, you must ensure the board is already in Maskrom mode (during power-on, if the Maskrom button is detected as pressed, the board will automatically enter Maskrom mode).

On Windows, to use RKDevTool you need to download and install the [Rockchip_DriverAssistant](https://dl.radxa.com/tools/windows/Rockchip_DriverAssitant_v4.8.zip) driver.
