The Yocto Project (YP) is an open source collaboration project that helps developers create custom Linux-based systems regardless of the hardware architecture.
Now we introduce the Yocto build for the Radxa boards based on Rockchip SoC.
There are two mains versions, community version and manufacturer version.

## Community version

The purpose of the layer, meta-rockchip, is to provide OpenEmbedded BSP support for Rockchip-based devices using upstream sources as much as possible.

List of Radxa boards supported with YP 5.0 scarthgap:

- radxa-zero-3e
- radxa-zero-3w
- rock-3a
- rock-5a
- rock-5b
- rock-pi-4a
