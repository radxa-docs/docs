## Usage for rkdeveloptool

### View connected Maskrom devices

```bash
rkdeveloptool ld
```

### Write file

:::tip
rkdeveloptool does not automatically decompress compressed files when writing to them.

First extract the used files and specify the extracted files in rkdeveloptool.
:::

:::tip
rkdeveloptool does not support the selection of Maskrom devices, nor can it select the storage media to be written to.
Normally when using rkdeveloptool, only a device and a storage medium are connected in hardware. This step cannot be controlled by software.

If you need to write to multiple devices at the same time, use upgrade_tool.
:::

```bash
sudo rkdeveloptool db <loader>
sudo rkdeveloptool wl 0 <image>
```
