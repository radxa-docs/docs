In embedded Linux systems, a Watchdog Timer (WDT) is a hardware and software mechanism used to monitor the system's operational state. Its main purpose is to automatically trigger a reboot when the system encounters failures (such as a crash, freeze, or program hang), ensuring the system recovers from abnormal states.

### Enablethe Watchdog

The hardware watchdog is disabled by default. It needs to be enabled using the <a href={props.rsetup_path} alt="rsetup path" > rsetup </a> to activate the watchdog overlay.

### Testing the Watchdog

- Run the following command to stop feeding the watchdog. The watchdog will automatically reboot the system:

```bash

echo B > /dev/watchdog

```

:::warning

You can write any character except for uppercase V, as uppercase V is used to disable the watchdog.

:::

- Disable system panic reboot:

```bash

echo 0 > /sys/module/kernel/parameters/panic

```

- Simulate a system freeze:

```bash

echo c > proc/sysrq-trigger

```

- Wait for approximately 30 seconds to see if the system reboots. If the system successfully reboots, it indicates that the watchdog is functioning correctly.
