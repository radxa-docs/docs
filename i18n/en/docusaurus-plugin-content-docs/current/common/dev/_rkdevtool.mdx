### Connect the product and enter Maskrom mode

Please refer to the instructions of the product for operation. The way to enter Maskrom mode varies slightly from product to product.

:::tip
Although RKDevTool supports the selection of Maskrom devices, writing to multiple devices at the same time will result in a write failure for the device being written to.

If you need to write to multiple devices at the same time, use upgrade_tool.

RKDevTool does not automatically decompress compressed files when writing to them.
