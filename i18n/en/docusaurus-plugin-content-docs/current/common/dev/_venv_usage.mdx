On Radxa OS, installing Python libraries system-wide with `pip3` is restricted by the system. You can use a Python virtual environment to isolate project dependencies from the system environment.

```bash
error: externally-managed-environment

× This environment is externally managed
╰─> To install Python packages system-wide, try apt install
    python3-xyz, where xyz is the package you are trying to
    install.
```

### Install the virtual environment tools

```bash
sudo apt install python3-venv
```

### Create a virtual environment

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
```

### Activate the virtual environment

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### Upgrade pip

```bash
pip3 install --upgrade pip
```

### Deactivate the virtual environment

```bash
deactivate
```
