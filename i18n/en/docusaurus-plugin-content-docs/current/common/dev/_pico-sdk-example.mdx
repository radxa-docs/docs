### PICO-SDK

#### 1. Introduction

The Raspberry Pi Pico SDK (henceforth the SDK) provides the headers, libraries and build system necessary to write programs for the RP2040-based devices (such as the Raspberry Pi Pico/{props.product_name}) in C, C++ or assembly language.

The SDK is designed to provide an API and programming environment that is familiar both to non-embedded C developers and embedded C developers alike. A single program runs on the device at a time and starts with a conventional main() method.
Standard C/C++ libraries are supported along with C level libraries/APIs for accessing all of the RP2040's hardware include PIO (Programmable IO).

#### 2. Usage

:::tip

You can either download pico-sdk/pico-examples and install the tools on your PC in a Linux environment, or you can do it in the Linux environment of {props.product_name}. For convenience, we can do this directly in the Linux environment of {props.product_name}.

:::

- Install the necessary tools

```
sudo apt update -y
sudo apt install -y git cmake gcc-arm-none-eabi libnewlib-arm-none-eabi libstdc++-arm-none-eabi-newlib
```

- Get the code

```
git clone https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-sdk.git
cd pico-sdk
git submodule update --init
```

### PICO-EXAMPLES

#### 1. Introduction

pico-examples is an official example codebase that shows how to use the Raspberry Pi Pico and the Pico SDK to implement a variety of features.
It provides a range of examples covering everything from basic GPIO operations to complex communication protocols to get developers up to speed and understanding how to develop on the Pico.

- Compile

```
export PICO_SDK_PATH=path/to/pico-sdk
cd pico-examples
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. && make -j4
