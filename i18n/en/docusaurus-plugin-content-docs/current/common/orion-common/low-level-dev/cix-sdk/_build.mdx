## Initialize the CIX SDK Build Environment

In the SDK root directory, execute the following commands to load the build tools and install build dependencies:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
. ./build-scripts/envtool.sh
newer_env
sudo apt-get install python-is-python3 7zip meson apt-utils
```

Then, you can execute the following commands to download and extract additional binary resources:

```bash
i=$((1))
get_cix_ext() {
    local block="$(printf "%03d" $1)"
    echo "https://github.com/radxa-pkg/cix-prebuilt/releases/download/$EX_CUSTOMER-$EX_PROJECT-$EX_VERSION/cix-sdk-ext.7z.$block"
}
while wget "$(get_cix_ext "$i")"; do
    i=$((i + 1))
done
7zz x cix-sdk-ext.7z.001
# Later system should use 7z instead of 7zz, as the command was renamed.
# Optionally, remove the downloaded files:
# rm cix-sdk-ext.7z.*
```

Your system is now ready for SDK compilation.

## Common Commands and Build Targets

The following commands require loading `envtool.sh` first:

- `help`: Display SDK command help
- `build all`: Compile all components and generate the final runnable image

## Build Artifacts

After `build all` completes, you can find the following build artifacts:

- `output/cix_evb/images/linux-fs.sdcard`: System image
- `output/cix_evb/images/cix_debian.iso`: Modified Debian installation ISO
- `output/cix_evb/images/cix_flash_all_O6.bin`: Orion O6 BIOS image
- `output/cix_evb/images/cix_flash_all_O6N.bin`: Orion O6N BIOS image
