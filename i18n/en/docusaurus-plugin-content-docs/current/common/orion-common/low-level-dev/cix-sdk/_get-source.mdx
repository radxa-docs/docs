With authorization from CIX, Radxa has published the public portion of the CIX SDK on GitLab. Users can use this SDK to perform secondary development on O6 / O6N.

:::info
The CIX SDK only supports compilation on Debian 11 / Ubuntu 22.04 systems. A minimum of 100GiB of available storage space is required.

When running the SDK in a container, you may encounter permission issues. It is recommended to use a physical machine or virtual machine for compilation.

## Obtaining the `repo` Tool

The SDK provides a [`repo`](https://gerrit.googlesource.com/git-repo) compatible
[manifest](https://gitlab.com/cix-linux/linux_repo/cix-manifest) to help users quickly restore the code file structure locally.

Before downloading the SDK, please first install the tool on your system. For Debian systems, you can use the following commands:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install repo
```

For reference on using the `repo` command, please see the [`AOSP` documentation](https://source.android.com/docs/setup/reference/repo).

## Pulling the Source Code

Execute the following commands:

```bash
mkdir cix-sdk
cd cix-sdk
repo init https://gitlab.com/cix-linux/linux_repo/cix-manifest.git -b radxa-orion -m radxa_orion_release.xml
repo sync
```

After the code has finished downloading, you can proceed with [software compilation](build).
