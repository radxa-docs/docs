## NPU Introduction

Radxa Orion O6 / O6N features up to 28.8 TOPS NPU (Neural Processing Unit) computing power, supporting acceleration for INT4 / INT8 / INT16 / FP16 / BF16, and TF32 data types.
This document explains how to use the CIX P1 NPU SDK to run AI models and applications with NPU-accelerated inference. It includes step-by-step guides for model compilation tools, toolchains, and example implementations of common models.

## CIX Early Bird Program

The NPU SDK includes NOE Compiler and CIX AI Model Hub. To obtain the SDK, you need to apply for the CIX Early Bird Program.
Application link: [CIX Early Bird Program](https://earlybird.cixtech.com/#/)

## Install NPU SDK (x86 Linux Environment)

After applying through the [CIX Early Bird Program](#cix-early-bird-program), you will receive an email with download instructions for the SDK.

```bash
tar -xvf nor.tag.gz
```

:::tip
The CIX P1 NPU SDK is installed on an X86 host system and requires Python 3.8.

Please prepare a Python 3.8 environment. We recommend using [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download).

### Install NOE Compiler

NOE Compiler is used for model compilation, converting models from ONNX framework format to a format that can be accelerated by the NPU for inference.

```bash
cd noe
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
pip3 install ./CixBuilder-6.1.2958.1-py3-none-any.whl
```

## ~Install NOE UMD (Orion O6 / O6N)~

:::tip
~The NOE UMD package is released as a .deb package. If using the Python API, please inherit system dependencies when creating a virtual environment: **`python3 -m venv --system-site-packages .venv`**~
:::
~After applying through the [CIX Early Bird Program](#cix-early-bird-program), you will receive an email with instructions to download the UMD (User Mode Driver) .deb package~

~`bash
sudo dpkg -i ./cix-noe-umd_0.01-1_arm64.deb
~`~

:::tip
NOE UMD is pre-installed in the OS. If using the Python API, please inherit system dependencies when creating a Python virtual environment: **`python3 -m venv --system-site-packages .venv`** to ensure the libnoe module is loaded correctly.
