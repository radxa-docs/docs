## NPU Overview

Radxa Orion O6 / O6N delivers up to 28.8 TOPS of NPU (Neural Processing Unit) performance and supports INT4 / INT8 / INT16 / FP16 / BF16, and TF32 acceleration.

This document explains how to use the CIX P1 NPU SDK to run AI models and applications that leverage NPU-accelerated inference. It covers the compilation tools, toolchains, and step-by-step guidance for common sample models.

## CIX SDK

Visit the [CIX Developer Center](https://developer.cixtech.com/) to download the latest CIX AI development toolkit (NeuralONE AI SDK).

The CIX P1 AI development toolkit supports heterogeneous hardware acceleration, including NPUs, enabling energy-efficient edge AI inference.

### Download the SDK

Register and sign in to the [CIX Developer Center](https://developer.cixtech.com/). Inside the Software SDK section, click **Learn more** under the NeuralONE AI SDK entry to start the download automatically.

### Extract the SDK

```bash
tar -xvf cix_noe_sdk_xxx_release.tar.gz
```

After extraction, the folder contains the following files:

- cix-noe-umd_xxx_arm64.deb
- cix-npu-driver_xxx_arm64.deb
- CixBuilder_xxx-cp310-none-linux_x86_64.whl
- env_setup.sh
- npu_sdk_last_manifest_list.xml
- requirements.txt

### Install the NPU Driver

Change into the extracted folder and run the following command to install the NPU driver:

```bash
sudo dpkg -i ./cix-npu-driver_xxx_arm64.deb
```

### Install the NOE Compiler

The NOE Compiler converts ONNX models into a format optimized for NPU-accelerated inference.

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
pip3 install ./CixBuilder_xxx-cp310-none-linux_x86_64.whl
```

### Install NOE UMD

```bash
sudo dpkg -i ./cix-noe-umd_xxx_arm64.deb
```

### Verify the Installation

Use the `cixbuild` command to confirm that the NOE Compiler is installed correctly.

```bash
cixbuild -v
```
