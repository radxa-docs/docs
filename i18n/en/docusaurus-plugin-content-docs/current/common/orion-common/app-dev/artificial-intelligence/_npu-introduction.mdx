## NPU Introduction

Radxa Orion O6 / O6N features up to 28.8 TOPS NPU (Neural Processing Unit) computing power, supporting acceleration for INT4 / INT8 / INT16 / FP16 / BF16, and TF32 data types.
This document explains how to use the CIX P1 NPU SDK to run AI models and applications with NPU-accelerated inference. It includes step-by-step guides for model compilation tools, toolchains, and example implementations of common models.

## CIX NPU SDK

The NPU SDK includes the NOE Compiler and CIX AI Model Hub. To obtain the SDK, you need to apply for a CIX Developer Account.
Application link: [CIX Developer Account Application](https://developer.cixtech.com/)

## Install NPU SDK (x86 Linux Environment)

After applying through the [CIX Developer Account Application](#cix-npu-sdk), log in to your account and download the CIX P1 NPU SDK archive `cix_noe_sdk_xx_xx_release.tar.gz`.

<NewCodeBlock tip="x86 Linux PC" type="PC">

```
tar -xvf cix_noe_sdk_xx_xx_release.tar.gz  # replace with the actual file name
```

</NewCodeBlock>

:::tip
The CIX P1 NPU SDK is installed on an X86 host system and requires Python 3.8.

Please prepare a Python 3.8 environment. We recommend using [miniforge](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge) or another Python virtual environment.

### Install NOE Compiler

NOE Compiler is used for model compilation, converting models from the ONNX framework format to a format that can be accelerated by the NPU for inference.

<NewCodeBlock tip="x86 venv" type="venv">

```
cd cix_noe_sdk_xx_xx_release/  # replace with the actual directory name
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
pip3 install ./CixBuilder-6.1.xxxx.x-py3-none-any.whl  # replace with the actual wheel file name
```

</NewCodeBlock>

## ~Install NOE UMD (Orion O6 / O6N)~

:::tip
~The NOE UMD package is released as a .deb package. If using the Python API, please inherit system dependencies when creating a virtual environment: **`python3 -m venv --system-site-packages .venv`**~
:::

The CIX P1 NPU SDK archive contains the NOE UMD packages `cix-noe-umd_xx_xx_arm64.deb` and `cix-npu-driver_x.x.x_arm64.deb`. Please copy these files to the Orion O6 / O6N device for installation.
~`bash
sudo dpkg -i ./cix-noe-umd_x.xxx-x_arm64.deb ./cix-npu-driver_x.x.x_arm64.deb  # replace with the actual file names
~`~

:::tip
NOE UMD is pre-installed in the OS. If using the Python API, please inherit system dependencies when creating a Python virtual environment: **`python3 -m venv --system-site-packages .venv`** to ensure the libnoe module is loaded correctly.
