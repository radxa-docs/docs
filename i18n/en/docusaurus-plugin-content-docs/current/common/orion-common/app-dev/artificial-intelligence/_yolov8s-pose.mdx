**YOLOv8-pose** is an advanced deep learning model specialized for human pose estimation, launched by Ultralytics. It inherits the excellent architecture of the YOLOv8 series in object detection and integrates object detection with keypoint localization in a single-stage inference process, enabling efficient capture of complex human movements.

- **Key Features**: Supports real-time human keypoint detection and pose recognition, capable of accurately locating human skeletal joint points. Widely used in human motion analysis, interactive games, behavior monitoring, and rehabilitation guidance.
- **Version Note**: This case uses the YOLOv8s-pose model. As a lightweight advanced version in the series, it maintains extremely high inference speed while enhancing feature extraction capabilities for complex backgrounds and limb occlusion scenarios by increasing model depth and channel count. It is currently the ideal choice for finding balance between performance and real-time performance, especially suitable for practical application scenarios that require both detection accuracy and edge deployment efficiency.
