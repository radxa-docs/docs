**OpenPose** is a pioneering real-time multi-person pose estimation architecture. With its original bottom-up mechanism based on Part Affinity Fields (PAFs), it avoids the limitation of traditional methods where computation grows rapidly with the number of people, enabling fast reconstruction of human skeletons in complex crowds.

- Key features: Supports simultaneous keypoint extraction for multiple people across body, hands, face, and feet, with strong multi-scale perception and spatial-structure modeling. It is widely used in motion capture, human-computer interaction, sports analytics, and security behavior recognition.
- Version notes: This example uses the standard OpenPose architecture. As a cornerstone of pose estimation, it uses a dual-branch network to regress both keypoint heatmaps and limb association vectors, effectively handling challenging cases such as occlusion and overlapping people. With its broad applicability and mature ecosystem, it remains a reliable classic choice for high-accuracy, multi-dimensional human perception.
