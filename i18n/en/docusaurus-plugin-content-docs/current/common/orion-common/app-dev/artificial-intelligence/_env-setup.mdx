## Overview

You need to access the CIX Developer Center to obtain the latest CIX AI development toolkit: NOE SDK (NeuralONE AI SDK).

NOE SDK leverages NPU heterogeneous hardware acceleration to help developers efficiently build and deploy energy-efficient edge AI inference applications.

:::tip CIX Developer Center

The CIX Developer Center provides resources such as SDKs, chip manuals, and development documentation.

:::

## Get the SDK

Register and sign in to the [CIX Developer Center](https://developer.cixtech.com/). Scroll to the Software SDK section and click `Learn more` for NeuralONE AI SDK. The SDK will be downloaded automatically.

Extract the SDK:

<NewCodeBlock tip="Linux PC" type="PC">

```bash
tar -zxvf cix_noe_sdk_xxx_release.tar.gz
```

</NewCodeBlock>

Extracted directory structure:

```bash
.
├── CixBuilder-6.1.3407.2-cp310-none-linux_x86_64.whl
├── cix-noe-umd_2.0.2_arm64.deb
├── cix-npu-driver_2.0.1_arm64.deb
├── env_setup.sh
├── npu_sdk_last_manifest_list.xml
└── requirements.txt
```

## Set up the host environment

### Create a virtual environment

It is recommended to use [miniconda](https://www.anaconda.com/docs/getting-started/miniconda/main) to manage virtual environments.

:::warning[Python version]
The SDK is only compatible with Python 3.10.
:::

<NewCodeBlock tip="Linux PC" type="PC">

```bash
conda create -n noe python=3.10
conda activate noe
```

</NewCodeBlock>

### Use the script to set up the development environment

<NewCodeBlock tip="Linux PC" type="PC">

```bash
bash env_setup.sh
```

</NewCodeBlock>

### Verify the build environment

Run `cixbuild -v` in the terminal to check the build environment version.

<NewCodeBlock tip="Linux PC" type="PC">

```bash
cixbuild -v
```

</NewCodeBlock>

## Set up the environment on the device

### Install the NPU driver

:::tip[NPU driver]
The official OS image for Radxa Orion O6 / O6N already includes the NPU driver, so you do not need to install it again.
:::

Copy the NPU driver package to the device and run the following command to install it.

<NewCodeBlock tip="O6 / O6N" type="device">

```bash
sudo dpkg -i ./cix-npu-driver_xxx_arm64.deb
```

</NewCodeBlock>

### Install NPU UMD

:::info[UMD]
UMD stands for User Mode Driver.

UMD provides standard APIs as a shared library. It parses application requests and coordinates with the NPU driver for resource allocation and task submission.

For detailed API usage, refer to [**API manual**](../../../../orion/o6/app-development/artificial-intelligence/API-manual.md).
:::

Copy the UMD package to the device and run the following command to install it.

<NewCodeBlock tip="O6 / O6N" type="device">

```bash
sudo dpkg -i ./cix-noe-umd_xxx_arm64.deb
```

</NewCodeBlock>
