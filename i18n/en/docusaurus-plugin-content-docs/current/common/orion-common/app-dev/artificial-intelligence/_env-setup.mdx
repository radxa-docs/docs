## Set up the host environment

### Create a virtual environment

It is recommended to use miniforge to manage virtual environments.

[Click](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge/releases/download/25.11.0-0/Miniforge3-25.11.0-0-Linux-x86_64.sh) to install the installation script.

## Set up the environment on the device

:::tip[NPU driver]
The official OS image for Radxa Orion O6 / O6N already includes the NPU driver, so you do not need to install it again.
:::

Run the command below to ensure the relevant environment on the board is correctly installed.

<NewCodeBlock tip="O6 / O6N" type="device">

```bash
sudo apt install cix-drivers-dkms cix-noe-umd cix-npu-onnxruntime task-cix-npu
```

</NewCodeBlock>

:::info[UMD]
UMD stands for User Mode Driver.

UMD provides standard APIs as a shared library. It parses application requests and coordinates with the NPU driver for resource allocation and task submission.

For detailed API usage, refer to [**API manual**](../../../../orion/o6/app-development/artificial-intelligence/API-manual.md).
