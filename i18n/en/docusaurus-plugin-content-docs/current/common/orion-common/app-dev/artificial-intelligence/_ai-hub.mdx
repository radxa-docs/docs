The CIX AI Model Hub is a collection of machine learning models optimized for deployment on CIX SOC. It includes AI model examples across various domains (such as computer vision, speech recognition, generative AI, and other open-source models) along with configuration files compiled for the CIX SOC NPU. This document primarily introduces how to download and run models from the AI Model Hub.

## Download CIX AI Model Hub Repository

After applying through the [CIX Early Access Program](./npu-introduction#cix-early-access-program), you will receive an email with instructions to access the AI Model Hub repository.

```bash
git clone https://e.coding.net/g-uaqh1479/ai-model-hub/ai_model_hub.git
```

Model example directory structure:

```bash

## Download Pre-compiled Models

For the examples in the CIX AI Model Hub, users can directly download the ONNX models and pre-compiled models from [ModelScope](https://modelscope.cn/models/cix/ai_model_hub_24_Q4/files) without needing to compile from source.

## Running the Models

### Environment Setup

Install the Python environment:

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

### Model Examples

1. Preprocess human-readable input into model input format
2. Run model inference
3. Post-process model output into human-readable format

All model example code can be run end-to-end on the O6 using the NPU:

```bash
python3 inference_npu.py
```

Additionally, you can run the end-to-end examples locally on an X86 host or on the O6 using CPU with OnnxRuntime:

```bash
python3 inference_onnx.py
```
