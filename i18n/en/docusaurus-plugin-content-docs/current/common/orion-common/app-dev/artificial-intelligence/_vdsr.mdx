**VDSR** is a milestone architecture in the development history of image super-resolution technology. It successfully increased the depth of convolutional neural networks to 20 layers for the first time, solving the convergence problem of deep networks by introducing global residual learning mechanisms, and establishing the core approach of learning "image residuals" rather than directly learning pixel values.

- **Key Features**: Supports multi-scale (2x, 3x, 4x) image super-resolution reconstruction with a single model, possessing powerful edge recovery capabilities and texture detail enhancement effects. Widely used in high-definition video conversion, digital image restoration, and medical image enhancement.
- **Version Note**: This case uses the standard VDSR architecture. The model effectively captures image context information through a large receptive field and achieves efficient training processes using high learning rates with gradient clipping techniques. As the pioneering work of deep super-resolution algorithms, it provides visual clarity far beyond traditional interpolation methods while maintaining structural simplicity, making it the classic cornerstone choice for studying super-resolution technology evolution and industrial deployment.
