**If you get an error flashing the OS image, try again manually.**

### 2.SD Card Brush

Please power off the Fogwise AirBox, insert the SD card, and connect the serial terminal (use usb type-a to type-c cable, type-c connects to the debug port of the Fogwise AirBox, type a connects to the computer, the baud rate is set to 115200, and the location of the debug port is in the [hardware-interface](/sophon/airbox/hardware-design/hardware-interface.md) to find it, then power up the whole machine. You will see
The SG2300X automatically enters the flashing process:

:::tip
If the burning process fails, usually caused by the chip is hot, then please wait for the chip to cool down to a certain degree and then re-power into the brush process!

## System Startup

- After successfully burning the image to emmc as described above, remove the microSD card and power up the Fogwise AirBox.

## Precautions

It is recommended that you use the sudo poweroff command when shutting down your computer, and try to avoid direct power off to avoid file system corruption.
