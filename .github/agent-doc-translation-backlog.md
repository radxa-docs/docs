# Agent Doc Translation Backlog

Snapshot date: 2026-02-27

## Scope

Translation placeholders have been fully removed in this branch.
Follow-up work focused on converting Chinese carry-over content inside `i18n/en` docs to English.

## Current Status

- Files with Chinese text under `i18n/en/docusaurus-plugin-content-docs/current`: `0`
- `docs` placeholder markers: `0`
- `i18n/en` placeholder markers: `0`

## Progress Update (2026-02-27)

- Translated all remaining Chinese content in `i18n/en` doc pages and shared partials.
- Preserved code blocks and MDX structure while translating prose, tips, comments, and sample outputs.
- Normalized `Home.md` metadata comments and `_zh` value strings in the English locale file to English content for consistency.
